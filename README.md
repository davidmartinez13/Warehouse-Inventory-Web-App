# Warehouse-Inventory-Web-App
Created a web application with flask, SQLAlchemy and WTForms.
This application has a form with submit button.
Using this form, users will be able to add item to the warehouse (SQL database). Every item will be represented by (at least) name and quantity (you can add more, for example material, date, ...)
After user adds an item to the warehouse, the page will refresh and an HTML table of all items will be updated.
